A way to controls drone using [UFO](https://github.com/ajmwagar/ufo)

This setup is using the `JJRC H61` but it would be easy to port it to other `UFO` supported devices

## Controls

Right now the controls are as follows (I'm left-handed):
- Pitch `U`/`O`
- Altitude `I`/`K`
- Yaw `J`/`L`
- Roll `H`/`;`

## Roadmap
- Camera stream over TCP
- Custom Controls
- Multi-Drone Support (waiting on upstream changes from UFO)
